# Probabilistic-Tractography
In neuroscience, tractography is a 3D modeling technique used to visually represent neural tracts using data collected by Difusion Weighted images.

This project simulates the described process in 2D.

The vector field is the simulation of a possible output from the DWI's. We then follow the field to generate the most probable tracts.
